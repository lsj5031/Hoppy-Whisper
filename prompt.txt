```

# Summary
Reviewed the repository planning materials (notably `plan.md` and `issues_easy_path.csv`) to verify the scope, but no actionable instructions beyond “try again” were provided, so no code or configuration changes were made.

# Testing
No tests were run (no changes).

Error during droid execution: Exec ended early: insufficient permission to proceed. Re-run with --auto medium or --auto high. For destructive commands, use --skip-permissions-unsafe.
