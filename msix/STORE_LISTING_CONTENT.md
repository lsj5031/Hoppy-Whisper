## Notes for Localization

When creating listings for additional languages:
1. Translate description naturally (not literal word-for-word)
2. Keep technical terms in English where appropriate (e.g., "DirectML", "ONNX")
3. Adjust cultural references if needed
4. Ensure character limits still met after translation
5. Update screenshot captions in target language
6. Consider locale-specific features (e.g., hotkey conventions)
