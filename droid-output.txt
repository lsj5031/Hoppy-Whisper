## Summary

I successfully analyzed the Parakeet codebase and removed unnecessary files. Here's what was accomplished:

### Files Removed (7):
1. **prompt.txt** - Meta file containing the issue description
2. **plan.md** - Old planning document (6,349 bytes)
3. **droid-output.txt** - Previous execution output
4. **issues_easy_path.csv** - GitHub issue import CSV  
5. **create_issues_easy_path.ps1** - Issue creation script
6. **parakeet.iss** - Inno Setup installer (not used by CI)
7. **build.ps1** - Build script that referenced non-existent spec file

### Files Added (1):
- **Parakeet_onefile.spec** - Single-file build spec required by CI workflow (was missing)

### Files Modified (1):
- **.gitignore** - Added exception to track Parakeet_onefile.spec

### Files Kept (All Necessary):
- **hook-onnx_asr.py**, **hook-onnxruntime.py**, **pyi_rth_onnx_dlls.py** - PyInstaller hooks used by build
- **version_info.txt** - Optional version metadata referenced in BUILD.md
- **Parakeet.spec** - Directory-based build configuration
- All source code (25 files in src/app/)
- All tests (20 files in tests/)
- All documentation (README.md, BUILD.md, SMOKE_TEST.md, CHANGELOG.md)

All syntax validation passed, and no references to removed files remain in the codebase. The build and test infrastructure is intact and ready to use.
