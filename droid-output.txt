# Summary
Initialized a Poetry-managed Python 3.11 project with a `src/app` layout covering tray, hotkey, audio, transcriber, cleanup, and history packages, plus MIT licensing. Added a README detailing quick start, planned hotkey flow, and troubleshooting guidance; generated a lockfile and validated the configuration with Poetry.

## Plan
- Install Poetry, define a PEP 621-based `pyproject.toml`, and lock dependencies for Python 3.11.
- Scaffold the `src/app` namespace with placeholder modules for tray, hotkey, audio, transcriber, cleanup, and history components.
- Provide repository documentation (README and MIT license) and verify setup via `py -3.11 -m poetry check`.

## Testing
- `py -3.11 -m poetry check`

## PR Status
