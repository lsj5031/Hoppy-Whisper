# Summary
- Added linting, type checking, and pre-commit tooling to the project, leaving placeholders untouched.
- Ensured the `app` package is recognized as typed by adding the `py.typed` marker and including it in packaging metadata.

## Plan
1. Extend `pyproject.toml` with the required development dependencies and tool configurations (Ruff, Mypy, Pre-commit).
2. Create supporting configuration files (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) and package markers to satisfy tooling expectations.
3. Refresh the Poetry lockfile and verify the new tooling by running lint, type-check, and pre-commit checks.

## Changes
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to declare Ruff, Mypy, and Pre-commit dev dependencies, configure Ruff and Mypy, and include the `py.typed` marker in the package.
- Generated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to run `ruff --fix` and `ruff-format` on commits.
- Added `src/app/py.typed` to mark the package as typed and regenerated `poetry.lock` with the new dependency set.

## Tests
- `python3 -m poetry run ruff check`
- `python3 -m poetry run mypy`
- `python3 -m poetry run pre-commit run --all-files`

## Additional Notes
- `prompt.txt` had existing modifications prior to this task and was left untouched by the current changes.
